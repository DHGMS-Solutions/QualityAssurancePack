DHGMS Quality Assurance Pack is a starter nuget package to stick in projects that bundles together various Roslyn Analyzers and other tools that can be handy in Quality Assurance of a development project. The projects bundled into this are subjective and may not suit your tastes, but it's a good proof of concept on how you can do something similar for your own team.

## Mission Statement
* Provide a simple package as a proof of concept around a starter for making Quality Assurance a central part of day to day development.
* Keep the project small and simple so won't require much ongoing maintenance.
